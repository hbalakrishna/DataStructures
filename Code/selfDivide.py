# Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.
#
# We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:
#
# All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
# All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
# Only the first letter in this word is capital if it has more than one letter, like "Google".
# Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
# Example 1:
# Input: "USA"
# Output: True
# Example 2:
# Input: "FlaG"
# Output: False

a = "USA"
if a[0].isupper() and a[-1:].isupper():
    print(a[0])
for i in a:
    print(i.isupper())
